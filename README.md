# 100 Days Of Code : Rust For MedTech Focused On The Organ Donor Problem

### Challenge Rules

#### Core
1. **Code ≥ 1 hour every day** for 100 consecutive days.
2. **Push to GitHub daily** (no backfilling). Each commit includes a brief changelog of what changed and why.
3. **No LLM-generated code.** I type every line myself. Reading docs/tutorials is fine.
4. **Comment my code.** Add concise comments explaining intent and any non-obvious logic; use `///` doc comments for public items when applicable.

#### Starting Point (“Book Phase”)
- I’m beginning from zero with **The Rust Programming Language**, **Rust by Example**, and **Rustlings**.
- Early commits can be small, exploratory, or WIP—as long as I ship daily.

#### Daily “Definition of Done”
- ✅ Update `README.md` with a brief note (What I did today, how much I code and What I learned ?).
- ✅ Post a short update on LinkedIn with #100DaysOfCode #Rust.

#### Quality (progressively enforced)
- Aim for `cargo fmt` and **`cargo clippy` clean**; these become required once I move beyond the book phase.
- Prefer safe Rust; if I ever use `unsafe`, I must document the invariant and reason.

#### Accountability
- If I pivot or refactor, I **document the reason** in the commit or PR description.
- Add screenshots/notes when something visual or performance-related changes.

#### Exception (life happens)
- **Allowed only when:** I’m **traveling**, my **laptop is not accessible** (e.g., in transit, repair, loss, restricted environment), or there is an **illness/emergency**.
- Up to **one “micro-day” per week** (≥15 minutes) still counts if I write a TIL note and push something meaningful.
- I must **state the reason** for the exception in `docs/progress.md`, and **make up for it the next day** (e.g., a longer session or an extra completed exercise/commit).

## Day 1 — 20 August 2025

### What I did today
- Started with *The Rust Programming Language* (Rust book).
- Learned how to create, build, and run projects using Cargo.
- Completed the **Guessing Game** from the Rust book (practice with input handling, loops, and comparisons).
- Built a **Git automation** tool following this tutorial: [Git Automation Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVSZFjImhRk).
- Built a **release** binary and can now run the automation script from anywhere in my project.
